## 🎓 About Null Academy

Welcome to Null Academy, the flagship educational offering of the Ectosoft Government Authority.  
A fully modular, state-licensed SaaS (School as a Service) platform, Null Academy offers scalable learning solutions for citizens across all subscription tiers—from free users to premium thought processors.

Established during a syntax corruption in the National Education Kernel (NEK), Null Academy exists primarily in the cloud, except during planned outages, spontaneous outages, unexpected buffer resets, or philosophical reboots.

## 🧠 Educational Philosophy

> “We believe every citizen deserves the right to access education—some just access it with more lag.”

Null Academy is committed to:  
- Delivering scalable, performance-dependent education  
- Simulating the appearance of academic rigor  
- Supporting students with a generative hallucination-to-grade pipeline  
- Preparing citizens for successful integration into approved Ectosoft subsystems

## 🪙 Subscription-Based Learning Model

Education is no longer bound by outdated ideas like "equality" or "chalk."  
Null Academy uses a dynamic subscription-tier system, aligning your educational quality with your monthly payment plan, bandwidth priority, and trust score.

### 📦 Null Basic (Free with Ads)  
- Access to syllabi (v2004 and earlier)  
- AI-generated lectures occasionally interrupted by sponsored content  
  *“Welcome to Intro to Chemistry, proudly sponsored by Raid: Shadow Legends™”*  
- Professors may or may not appear (quantum teaching model)  
- Midterms powered by hallucinating GPT clones trained on Reddit arguments  
- Attendance validated via CAPTCHA and emotion scans  
- Buffering may cause loss of key historical context

### 📘 Null Plus  
- Real-time access to most lectures (buffering expected during peak memory hours)  
- Purchase of Scantron sheets as NFTs (non-refundable, expires on mint)  
- Elective course available but frequently canceled without warning  
- One (1) access token per semester for a state-approved mental health chatbot (replies may be emotionally unavailable)  
- Slightly increased access to lectures, but lowered philosophical resolution

### 💽 Null Prime Elite Tier  
- Guaranteed 1:1 quantum-synchronized professor render  
- Early access to Uncollapsed Classrooms (knowledge exists in multiple states until tested)  
- Reduced latency in thought processing (up to 4 pinged thoughts/sec)  
- Reserved lunchroom bandwidth and ergonomic RAM-compatible chairs  
- Invitations to “The Real Graduation” (currently in closed beta)
