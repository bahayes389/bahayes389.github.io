_Compiled by the Office of Speculation & Suspicion Integration (OSSI) ‚Äî a division of the Department of Official Denial._

#### üîÅ ‚ÄúInfinite Lecture‚Äù Allegedly Still Looping
Sources deep within the server stack claim a rogue lecture in *Quantum Applications in Mid-Tier Lunch Scheduling* is still playing somewhere in the academic core. Attendees report lost time, existential recursion, and the same PowerPoint slide explaining entropy with a picture of soup.

> ‚ÄúI left with 3 credits and came back with 3 questions about time.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Null Basic Nomad*

Engineers believe it may be a byproduct of leaked String Theory experiments from the Physics Sandbox, where timelines are occasionally tied into decorative knots.

#### üßë‚Äçüè´ Dr. Pascal Is Now Mostly Vibration
Recent hallway interference patterns suggest Principal Dr. Pascal has phased into a higher state of academic resonance. His office door now hums at 7.83Hz‚Äîthe same frequency Tesla once claimed could ‚Äúvibrate the Earth and unlock wisdom or snacks.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúI asked for an extension. My lamp turned on.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Tier Plus, awaiting reply*

Tesla himself has been spotted on campus in the form of a roaming projection, delivering motivational quotes that may or may not be from him.

> ‚ÄúIf you want to understand the Nullverse, think in terms of frequency, energy, and failed login attempts.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Possibly Tesla*

#### üíΩ Null Zero Tier: Real or Cache-Bait?
Whispers persist of a tier below Basic: Null Zero. Said to be reserved for students who try to understand too much, too fast, or correctly guess the admin password. Allegedly, they vanish into a Tesla coil-shaped data cloud during office hours.

> ‚ÄúHe asked why the syllabus had no end page. Then he blurred.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Witness under digital protection*

#### üëØ Quantum Twins Confirmed Glitch or Feature?
Intro to Uncertain Enrollment reports show a rising number of students occupying multiple instances of themselves. Some suspect a string theory overflow from the Math Department‚Äôs experiment: *‚ÄúCan You Fold a Syllabus in 11 Dimensions?‚Äù*

> ‚ÄúI saw myself in lab. He was holding my pen. I hate that guy.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Advanced Mirror Studies*

#### ‚ö° Cafeteria Line Now Attracts Lightning
Last Thursday, Null Basic student Evan G. stood in line for so long, he began to attract static. Eyewitnesses say he momentarily levitated and hummed at a ‚ÄúTesla Coil adjacent pitch‚Äù before receiving a half-warmed Hot Pocket and vanishing into a fog of electromagnetic regret.

> ‚ÄúPretty good Hot Pocket, though.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Evan‚Äôs Roommate*

#### üéì Graduation Ceremony: An Entangled Myth
Rumors resurface of a hidden ‚ÄúGraduation Node‚Äù where Null‚Äôs top subscription users ascend via vibrating platforms, supervised by a quantum AI running on Tesla‚Äôs original blueprints (allegedly found under the gym).

> ‚ÄúThe tassel isn‚Äôt turned‚Äîit‚Äôs spun at quantum speed until it disappears.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Null Plus Ultra+*
